====================
Release Notes
====================

Version 0.2
---------------------------
This release introduces directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based function evaluation, optimizing computation speed and structure.
It also includes vectorized circuit calculations and new nonlinear circuit elements (:code:`RCDQ`, :code:`RCDQn`, :code:`RCSQ`, :code:`RCSQn`) for enhanced modeling flexibility. ðŸš€ 

**What's Changed** `#27 <https://github.com/yuefan98/nleis.py/pull/27>`_

**Execution Graph**  

- Added support to graph-based function evaluation (:code:`graph = True`)
- `Documented <https://nleispy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/graph_example.html>`_ speed benchmarks (at least 3x faster than :code:`eval()`)
- Updated compute method to return impedance values

**Computation Optimization**

- Vectorized circuit element calculations for faster performance

**New Circuit Elements**

- Added support to nonlinear RC with constant phase element: (:code:`RCDQ`, :code:`RCDQn`), and (:code:`RCSQ`, :code:`RCSQn`)

- Full support for nonlinear equivalent circuit (nECM) modeling and analysis.
- Various linear and nonlinear circuit element pairs derived from existing literature.
- Seamless integration with impedance.py for expanded impedance analysis capabilities.

**Improvements:**

- Comprehensive `documentation <https://nleispy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, including a Getting Started guide and API reference.
- Improved documentation for supported circuit elements.
- Improved code handling for better performance and readability. 

**Bug Fixes**

- Initial testing and issue resolution to ensure smooth functionality.

**New Contributors**

- Special thanks to @mdmurbach for joining the team and enhancing the package quality.
